ABSTRACT
Project aims at training best working model for plant disease detection and diagnosis using healthy and diseased leaves of three different plants in ten distinct classes. We discuss the progress made leading to current development scene and possible future enhancements. This project deals with efficient and new technique for real time plant-leaf disease detection in field of agriculture. Main objective behind this project is to understand the deep learning architecture, neural networks and application of same in leaf disease detection system. It includes preparation of dataset consisting of healthy and diseased leaves and pre-processing of same for training and testing of model.
